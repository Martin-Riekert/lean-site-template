EA meetups are informal events for people interested in effective altruism to meet up, get to know each other better, exchange thoughts and ideas. Feel free to just drop by, and bring along interested friends! There will be no formal program but hopefully a lot of great conversations and fun! EA Stuttgart meetups are held every month. Foreigners and non-German speakers are very welcome. We speak English during the meetup. You can find us in the first floor of **[Dean & David](https://www.google.de/maps/place/Dean+%26+David/@48.7826502,9.1694814,15z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1sdean+and+david+stuttgart!3m4!1s0x4799db49adb60fd5:0xbf8123c46f08a879!8m2!3d48.775128!4d9.1726715)**.
